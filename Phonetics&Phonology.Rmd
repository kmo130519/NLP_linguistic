> ## Phonetics and Phonology
    
* Both deal with speech sounds
  * Phonetics: The Sounds of Language
  * Phonology: The Sound Patterns of Language
* Phonetics studies the surface, physical aspects of sounds (the sounds that we actually use)
  * how the speech sounds are made (articulatory phonetics)
  * how the speech sounds are perceived (auditory phonetics)
  * the physics involved (acoustic phonetics)
* Phonology 
  * how speech sounds are organized into systems
  * how the sounds can be combined, the relations between them, and how they affect each other the underlying, mental aspects of sounds concerning what’s in our head
 
- - -
  
> ## Phonetics

* The study of speech (that occur in all human languages to represent meanings)    
* The inventory of speech sounds in a language differ from those in another.    
* The entire inventory of speech sounds in all languages is still a limited set.  

- - -

> ## Sound Segments

* segment(ation)
* "cat" has three sounds, but physically they are just one continuum.
* The continuum exists even across words, phrases and sentences.
* Segmenting ability is a part of linguistic knowledge of all human
speakers

- - -

> ## Identity of Speech Sounds

* Same sounds are produced differently by different speakers and even by the same speaker. Personal differences are not linguistically significant.
* Nonlinguistic sounds are ignored.
* But, What about computers?

- - -

> ## The Phonetic Alphabet

* orthography
  * spelling-sound inconsistency
  * spelling reform
* IPA (International Phonetic Association) in 1888
  * phonetic alphabet
    * IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet): diacritical marks, schwa, engma
* Machine readable conventions
  * Using only keyboard friendly fonts (ASCII Characters)
  * Frequently used in the fields of speech technology
  * Major versions
  * CMUbet by Carnegie Mellon University
  * SAMPA by University College London
  
- - -

> ## Basic events of speech production

* Initiation (respiration)
  * Creating the flow of air
  * No substantial sound yet
* Phonation
  * Making the air flow vocalic
  * As a simple buzzing sound
* Articulation
  * Modifying and amplifying the simple vocalic sound
  * Various speech sounds
  
- - - 

> ## Articulatory Phonetics - consonants

* Place of Articulation
  * Labials : lips
  * Interdentals : between teeth
  * Alveolars : alveolar ridge(tooth ridge)
  * Palatals : palate
  * Velars : velum (soft palate)
  * Glottals : glottis
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Vocal tract", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/vocal.png")
```

- - - 

> ## Ariculatory Phonetics - vowels

Vowel features :   

* Tongue height
* Tongue backness
* Lip rounding
* Tenseness (or length)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="English Vowels", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/vowels.png")
```

> ## Definition of sound

Energy variations that travel through the medium    
Possible mediom : 

* Gas : air
* Liquid : water
* Solid : pipe, railroad track

- - -

> ## What makes sounds different?

Major characteristics of sounds :

* Pitch
* Loudness
* Quality
* Length

- - -

> ## Method of representing sound acoustically

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}

```

> ## Air particle movements

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/airmove.png")
```

> ## Sound wave

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap='sound waves', fig.subcap=c('Simulated Air Particle Movement', 'Simple wave', 'Loudness represented by waveform amplitude','Pitch represented by waveform frequency'), out.width='50%', fig.ncol=2, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/2.png")

knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/4.png")
```

> ## Summary on frequency

* Typical average pitches used in speaking
  * Children: 265Hz
  * Women: 226Hz
  * Men: 120Hz
* Audible Frequency
  * Human: 20Hz (or16Hz) –20KHz
  * Bats: 20KHz –100KHz
* Fastest telephone vibration: 35KHz
* Most of the human speech sound frequency: below 8KHz

- - -

> ## Waveform is not sufficient

Two sounds with the same pitch and loudness can still differ    

  * Example) Violin A vs. Piano A
  * Example) [i] vs. [ɑ]

- - -

> ## Pure tone vs. Complex Wave

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap='sound waves', fig.subcap=c('Pure tone', 'Complex wave'), out.width='50%', fig.ncol=2, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/puretone.png")
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/complexwave.png")

```

> ## Periodic vs aperiodic wave

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/period.png")
```

- - -

> ## Waveform and Spectrum

* 100Hz + 200Hz + 300Hz
* Waveform은 x축이 time이지만, spectrum은 어느 한 순간의 분포를 알려준다.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/spectrum.png")
```


- - -

> ## Disadvantages of Spectrum Representation

* Less intuitive
  * X-axis denotes frequency level
  * No time varying representation
* Hard to see interaction with Waveforms
* Thus, a new way of representation needed    

→ **Spectrogram**


- - - 

> ## Waveform & Spectogram aligned


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rdata/NLP_linguistic/pngfiles/specto.png")
```

모음은 진폭의 일정한 period가 존재하고, 분포의 F1(*Height*), F2(*Backness*), F3(*Backness, lip rounding & personal characteristics*)을 통해 모음의 종류를 파악할 수 있다. 자음은 aperiodic sound이므로 조금은 복잡한 방법으로 알아내야 한다. 파찰 등의 증거 등에서 읽는다던지 한다.

> ## Prosody (운율)

Stress, intonation, rhythm, tone(성조, 억양, 강세, 리듬, 음절)..    
Are prosodic features redundant?    
Are prosodic features language universal?

- - -

> ## Intonation as a phonemic feature    

A segmental string can be ambiguous in meaning → intonation disambiguates meanings    

* Example
  * Marge has a new computer. (Fall: statement)
  * Marge has a new computer. (Rise: question)

> ## Phonology

Phonology tells you what combinations of sounds could be an actual word, whether it is or isn’t, and what combination of sounds could not be an actual word.    
Phonology explains why certain phonetic features are important to identifying a word. 

* voicing: pin vs. bin (phoneme)
* aspiration: pin vs. spin (allophone)

- - - 

> ## The Phonological Units of Language

* Phonemes: the basic form of a sound in one’s mind
* Phones: a particular realization (pronunciation) of a phoneme
* Allophones: the collection of phones that are the realizations of the same phoneme


- - -

> ## Rules of phonology

* Assimilation
  * Pass vs. pass you[패슈]
  * 신라[실라] vs. Only[올리], Henry[헬리] (produced by Korean native)
* Dissimilation
  * anecdot-al vs. angul-ar
* Insertion
* Deletion
  * myst**e**ry
* Devoicing
